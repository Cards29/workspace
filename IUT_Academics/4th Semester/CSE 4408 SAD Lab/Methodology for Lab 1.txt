Great! Here's a sample Agile development plan tailored to your university carpooling app:

---

### 🎯 Project: IUT Carpool (Peer-to-peer carpooling system for university students)

---

## 🧩 Product Backlog (User Stories)

These are high-level features that will be broken into tasks during sprints.

1. 🧑‍🎓 As a student, I want to create an account with my IUT credentials.
2. 🚗 As a car owner, I want to list my available seats, destination, time, and fee (or set it free).
3. 🔍 As a student, I want to search for available rides to Dhaka.
4. 📩 As a rider, I want to request a seat and get confirmation from the car owner.
5. 💬 As a user, I want to chat or message the driver after confirmation.
6. 📅 As a user, I want to see my upcoming and past rides.
7. ⭐ As a rider, I want to rate and review the driver after the ride.
8. 🛡️ As an admin, I want to verify users and resolve disputes.
